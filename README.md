Core Enhancements

Task Categories / Tags

Let users assign tasks to categories (e.g., “Work,” “Personal,” “Fitness”) or add custom tags.

Add color-coded tags for quick visual distinction.

Use filter chips or dropdowns to view tasks by category.

Subtasks

Add checklists inside a main task.

Useful for breaking down bigger tasks (e.g., “Prepare for meeting” → “Write notes,” “Send slides”).

Due Dates & Reminders

Integrate a date picker for deadlines.

Add notifications or visual reminders (e.g., color change when overdue).

Priority Levels

Let users set priority: High / Medium / Low (color-coded or with icons like 🔥 ⬆️ ⬇️).

Sort or filter tasks by priority.

Search & Smart Filtering

Implement a search bar to quickly find tasks by keyword.

Combine with filters (e.g., “Show high-priority tasks due today”).
